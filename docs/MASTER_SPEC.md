# MASTER_SPEC (Append-Only Governance)

## Governance Rule
This document is append-only. Existing sections are never deleted or rewritten in-place; updates are added as dated amendments.

## Phase 0 baseline
- Monorepo root established at `AIFRED_Foundation`.
- Source repo `Free_API` remains immutable and is copied into `apps/aifred_chat`.
- Build scaffold introduced for deterministic core development without altering copied chatbot behavior.

## Change control
- Any policy or architecture changes must be appended as a new section with timestamp and rationale.
- No destructive rewrites of prior decisions.
